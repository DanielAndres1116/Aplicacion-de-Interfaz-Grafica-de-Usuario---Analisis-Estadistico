# 1. Interactive Interface: provision of user-friendly information

An Interactive Interface is a type of graphical user interface that allows users to interact with a computer program or digital device by performing actions such as clicking, typing, or dragging and dropping objects. This type of interface allows users to control and manipulate the content displayed on the screen, making it easier and more intuitive to use.

An Interactive Dashboard is a type of interface that presents information and data in a visual and interactive format. Dashboards typically display data in the form of graphs, charts, and tables, and allow users to interact with the data by drilling down into it, adjusting the visualization, or filtering the data. The goal of an interactive dashboard is to provide a clear, easy-to-understand representation of complex data that is customizable and can be used to gain insights into various aspects of a business or other organization.

Interactive Interfaces and Dashboards are important because they can make it much easier for users to understand and make use of large amounts of data. In today’s data-driven world, businesses and organizations must be able to quickly access, analyze, and make decisions based on vast amounts of data. Interactive dashboards allow them to do this by presenting the data in a clear and concise manner, making it easier to understand and identify trends and patterns.

In addition, interactive dashboards can also be used to improve collaboration and decision making. By providing a visual representation of data that can be easily shared and interacted with, interactive dashboards can help teams work together to make informed decisions based on the data.
Overall, interactive interfaces and dashboards are critical tools in today’s data-driven world, providing businesses and organizations with the ability to easily access, understand, and make use of large amounts of data to drive decision making and improve their overall operations.
